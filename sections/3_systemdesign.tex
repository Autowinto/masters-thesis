\section{System Design and Data}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Train classification model on legal data and sagsvurderingsdata
  \item SHAP Explainer extracts token-contributions and weights (Important to check training dataset for things like company name and other things that can maybe skew.)
  \item Pass structured SHAP data for each legal document to a reasoning model that produces human-readable reasoning.
  \item Final legal risk assessment after every document has been processed.
\end{enumerate}
