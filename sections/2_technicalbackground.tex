Predicting whether a case can be won initially, requires the use of a classification model. Classification models are supervised machine learning tools, enabling sorting of data into several categories, labels or simply yes and no, based on certain patterns provided from labeled data. Labeled data in the case of LegalTech personal injury case estimation, would be all the data that a lawyer typically uses to come to a conclusion, with the addition of a label specifying whether the case was won or not. Based on this, a classification model is trained or fine-tuned.

There are several types of classification models. Three of the most commmon types are binary classification models, multi-class classification models and the multi-label classification models. The focus of this thesis will be on binary classification models, as winning a case or not winning a case is a binary matter.

Skriv hvad fine-tuning er og hvad fordele kan være over at træne egen model fra bunden.

Another challenge is the legal language. Fine-tuning on a base classification model is a good start, however,

Noget med forskellige teorier ift. beregning af certainty.

\subsection{AI Fairness}
There's also the issue of fairness, especially when performing classifications.
